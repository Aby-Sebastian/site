The smallest set of components and guidelines your organization needs to make your digital products consistently, efficiently, and quickly.

Many people have different and useful definitions for design systems:

Designer Alla Kholmatova calls design systems “a set of connected patterns and shared practices, coherently organized to serve the purposes of a digital product.”
Designer/developer Sylvee L. says design systems are “collections of rules, constraints, and principles, implemented in design and code.”
Designer Nathan Curtis says, “A design system offers a library of visual style, components, and other concerns documented and released by an individual, team or community as code and design tools so that adopting products can be more efficient and cohesive,” among other things.
Developer Jeremy Keith says, “I think we lose sight of the real value of a design system when we focus too much on the components. The components are the trees. The design system is the forest.”
Front-end designer Brad Frost says, “A design system [is] the official story of how your organization designs and builds digital products.”
